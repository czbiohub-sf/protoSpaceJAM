Hi Max,

To score S.aureus guides, first download Azimuth-2.0 from here. Make sure to
include Azimuth in your path before running the python script to score sgRNAs. 

I have attached a python script that takes as input:

    .txt file with first column as 21mer sgRNA sequences and second column as the 36mer context sequence of the format NNNN[21mer]NNGRRNNNNNN
        Model file attached with this email
            Outputfile name

            Also attached is an excel file with prediction scores for a few
            guides. Let me know if you are able to reproduce the results. 

            Thank you.
            Mudra
