gRNA scoring
------------
To rank all candidate gRNAs for a possible design, protoSpaceJAM uses a composite ranking score that weighs (1) the on-target specificity of each candidate, (2) the distance between cut and insertion sites, and (3) the position of the gRNA with respect to important gene expression regulatory sequences, namely 5â€™ untranslated regions (UTRs) and splice sites

Recoding strategy
-----------------
| Silent mutations are included in the DNA donor to:
| - Prevent recutting the genome after editing. 
| - Facilitate payload insertion when the cut-to-insert distance is inevitably large.  
|
| There are three recoding intesities: "full", "prevent recut", and "none". 
| In "full", the cut-to-insert region is recoded to facilitate payload insertion. The gRNA or split gRNA (disrupted by the payload, creating a protopsacer-half and a PAM-half) are also recoded.
| "Prevent recut" differs from "full" by the lack of recoding in the cut-to-insert region.

| Notes
| - The Cutting Frequency Determination (CFD) score was created by `Doench et al. <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4744125/>`_  to calculate the off-target potential of sgRNA:DNA interaction.

DNA donor processing strategy
-----------------------------
| After recoding, the DNA donors are further processed, in a type-specific way.
| There are two types of DNA donors:
| - Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) 
| - Single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODN)
